Some cogs I made for Discord Red

## AdventurePal
### Demo
Coming Soon(tm)
### Description
- Create choose your own adventure stories using a simple json file format
- Load them into a discord channel and have everybody play it at once
- Supports a bookmarking system that allows you to return to any previously visited state
- Different channels can have different story instances going at once
- Stories are automatically verified on load, with useful errors to help fix your story files
### Installation
Coming Soon(tm)
### Commands
Once a story is loaded, players can play just by typing in one of the options into chat. 

All commands are prefixed with [p]advpal
- load: Attach your story file to this message to load your story into the current channel
- bookmarks: List out the previously visited bookmarks
- reset [bookmark]: Return to the selected bookmark
- choose [option]: Same as typing in chat but prints a message to let you know if what you've selected is an invalid option
- unload: Unload a story from the current channel so you can type normally again without triggering this bot

## Bogdabot
### Description
